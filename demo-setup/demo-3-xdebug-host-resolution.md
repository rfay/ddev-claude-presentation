# Demo 3: GitHub Issue #7537 - Xdebug Host Resolution

**Issue:** Xdebug: figure out a better way for `host.docker.internal` inside all containers
**Time:** 12 minutes (including Q&A)
**Branch:** `demo/xdebug-host-resolution`

## Pre-Demo Setup

```bash
cd ddev-demo
git checkout demo/xdebug-host-resolution
code pkg/ddevapp/config.go  # Open container configuration
```

## Demo Script

### 1. Explain the Issue (2 minutes)

**Say:** "Issue #7537 addresses a cross-platform problem with Xdebug configuration. The current approach using `host.docker.internal` doesn't work consistently across all platforms and container environments."

**Show:**
- Navigate to the GitHub issue
- Explain Xdebug and why it needs host connectivity
- Show current problems on different platforms (macOS vs Linux vs Windows)

### 2. Understand Current Implementation (1 minute)

**Claude Code Query:**
```
"Explain how DDEV currently handles Xdebug host resolution and the host.docker.internal configuration. Show me the relevant code sections."
```

**Expected Response:** Claude should identify:
- Current Xdebug configuration methods
- Platform-specific host resolution
- Container networking setup

### 3. Analyze Cross-Platform Issues (2 minutes)

**Claude Code Query:**
```
"What are the cross-platform issues with host.docker.internal for Xdebug in Docker containers? How does this differ between macOS, Linux, and Windows?"
```

**Expected Analysis:**
- macOS: `host.docker.internal` works
- Linux: Often needs `172.17.0.1` or bridge IP
- Windows: Varies by Docker implementation
- Container networking complexities

### 4. Design Better Solution (3 minutes)

**Step 1:** Research platform detection
**Claude Code Query:**
```
"Help me design a cross-platform solution for Xdebug host resolution in DDEV. The solution should automatically detect the correct host IP for each platform."
```

**Step 2:** Implement detection logic
**Claude Code Query:**
```
"Implement a function that detects the correct Xdebug host IP based on the current platform and Docker configuration. Use DDEV's existing platform detection patterns."
```

**Step 3:** Update Xdebug configuration
**Claude Code Query:**
```
"Update the Xdebug configuration generation to use the dynamic host resolution instead of hardcoded host.docker.internal."
```

### 5. Handle Edge Cases (2 minutes)

**Claude Code Query:**
```
"What edge cases should we handle for Xdebug host resolution? Consider different Docker setups, networking modes, and container orchestration scenarios."
```

**Expected Edge Cases:**
- Custom Docker networks
- Rootless Docker
- WSL2 on Windows
- Remote Docker hosts
- Corporate firewalls/proxies

**Claude Code Query:**
```
"Add fallback mechanisms and error handling for cases where automatic detection fails."
```

### 6. Generate Tests (1 minute)

**Claude Code Query:**
```
"Generate unit tests for the cross-platform Xdebug host resolution, including mocks for different platform scenarios."
```

**Show:** Test cases covering:
- Platform detection accuracy
- Fallback mechanisms
- Error handling
- Configuration generation

### 7. Demo the Solution (1 minute)

**Show:** Walk through the implemented solution:
- Platform detection logic
- Dynamic host resolution
- Fallback mechanisms
- Updated configuration templates

## Key Teaching Points

1. **Cross-platform development** complexity
2. **AI helps with research** and solution design
3. **Robust error handling** for edge cases
4. **Testing across platforms** is essential

## Technical Deep Dive

**Container Networking Concepts:**
- Bridge networks vs host networks
- Platform-specific host resolution
- Docker daemon variations
- Security implications

**Xdebug Configuration:**
- xdebug.client_host setting
- IDE connection requirements
- Port forwarding considerations
- Performance implications

## Implementation Strategy

```go
// Pseudo-code for the solution
func detectXdebugHost() string {
    switch runtime.GOOS {
    case "darwin":
        return "host.docker.internal"
    case "windows":
        return detectWindowsDockerHost()
    case "linux":
        return detectLinuxDockerHost()
    default:
        return fallbackHost()
    }
}
```

## Backup Materials

- Network diagrams showing different scenarios
- Configuration file examples
- Debug output from different platforms
- Performance comparison data

## Notes for Presenter

- This is the most technical of the three demos
- Be prepared to explain Docker networking concepts
- Emphasize the cross-platform testing challenges
- Show how AI helps with complex system-level programming
- Have fallback explanations for networking concepts if needed

## Potential Audience Questions

- How does this affect IDE configuration?
- What about performance impact?
- Can users override the automatic detection?
- How do you test this across all platforms?
