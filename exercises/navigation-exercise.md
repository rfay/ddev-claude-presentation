# DDEV Navigation Exercise - Provider System

## Objective
Practice using Claude Code to understand DDEV's provider architecture and navigation techniques.

## Background
DDEV uses a provider pattern to support different hosting platforms and cloud services. Understanding this pattern is crucial for DDEV development.

## Exercise Steps

### Step 1: Initial Exploration
1. Open the DDEV repository in your IDE with Claude Code
2. Ask Claude: "Show me how DDEV implements the provider pattern"
3. Follow up: "Find examples of provider implementations in the codebase"

### Step 2: Deep Dive
1. Ask Claude to explain one specific provider in detail
2. Have Claude create a summary of what you learned
3. Ask for the key interfaces in the provider system

### Step 3: Pattern Recognition
1. Ask Claude: "What are the common patterns across all DDEV providers?"
2. Follow up: "How would I implement a new provider for [platform of your choice]?"

## Expected Outcomes
- Understand DDEV's provider architecture
- Practice effective prompting techniques
- Experience Claude Code's navigation capabilities

## Sample Prompts
```
"Explain the provider pattern in DDEV with code examples"
"Show me how different providers are implemented"
"What are the key interfaces in the provider system?"
"How does the Docker provider differ from the Kubernetes provider?"
```

## Success Criteria
- You can explain the provider pattern to someone else
- You understand the key interfaces involved
- You can identify where to add a new provider
- You've practiced systematic code exploration

## Time Estimate
5-7 minutes during presentation, 30 minutes for extended practice

## Troubleshooting
- **No response?** Check your API key configuration
- **Generic answers?** Be more specific about what you want to see
- **Too much detail?** Ask Claude to summarize or focus on specific aspects

## Next Steps
After completing this exercise, try exploring other DDEV architectural patterns like the service system or command structure.
