# DDEV Development with Claude Code

**AI-Assisted Development Workflows Training Presentation**

This repository contains a contributor training presentation on using Claude Code for DDEV development workflows, demonstrating practical techniques for AI-assisted development in open source projects.

The framework here is [revealjs](https://revealjs.com/), based on markdown, easy to use. Next time I use it I'll let AI to less and do more myself. I like it a lot better than Google Slides.
