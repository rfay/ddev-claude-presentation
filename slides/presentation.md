### About Claude Code

#### Capabilities

**Claude Code Capabilities:**
- **AI pair programming assistant** with deep code understanding
- **Context-aware analysis** of large codebases and complex architectures  
- **Conversation-based workflow** for iterative development
- **Multi-language expertise** with particularly strong Go, Python, and JavaScript support
- **Real-time assistance** for coding, debugging, testing, and documentation

--

#### Key Strengths

- **Pattern recognition** in existing codebases
- **Code generation** following established conventions
- **Test creation** with comprehensive edge case coverage
- **Documentation writing** in multiple formats
- **Debugging assistance** with error analysis and solutions

--

#### Claude Limitations

- **Context windows** - works best with focused, specific tasks  
- **Knowledge cutoff** - may not know about very recent changes
- **Hallucination risk** - always verify generated code
- **Limited time usage** - they shut you off after unclear time, and you don't get to start again until later

--

🤖 **Key Principle:** Claude Code enhances human developers - it doesn't replace critical thinking and domain expertise

---

## Setup & Configuration

Note: Section 2 of 6 - Getting Claude Code ready for DDEV development

--

### Getting Started

- DDEV installed and working
- VS Code or JetBrains IDE (or no IDE at all)
- Git and GitHub CLI (optional but recommended)
- Claude Code installed and working 
- Claude Code/Anthropic account
- Basic Go knowledge helpful

---

### Basic Benefits

- Claude gives you a real chance to describe a problem or feature in careful detail, letting you think about and design the problem in advance. Use that, it helps you! And then it helps Claude.
- Being able to take on a problem using Claude has me far more willing to start on something I don't completely understand.
- For more complex problems or features, describe the solution to Claude in detail and ask it to write a PRD.
- Use git commits to keep track of where you are and be able to revert if things go bad. You can have Claude make commits with detailed messages.
- I've been very happy with these organizational principles.

### Strategies to Get The Most Value
- DDEV has a CLAUDE.md with basic instructions, you may need to adapt (but it's not very obedient)
- Static analysis and tests are a great way to keep Claude "on the rails"



## Technical Workflows

### Codebase Navigation

#### Understanding DDEV's Architecture

`Explain DDEV's project structure and architecture`

```

```

--

#### Advanced Navigation Techniques

**Start with the Entry Point:**  
`Show me the main() function and how DDEV processes commands`

This reveals `cmd/ddev/main.go` and the Cobra command structure.

--

**Follow the Data Flow:**  
`Trace the execution from 'ddev start' to container creation`

Response should show: `cmd/start.go` → `pkg/ddevapp/ddevapp.go` → Docker operations


---

### Strategic Code Discovery

#### Finding Implementation Details

**Command Implementation Pattern:**  
`Where is the ddev start command implemented?`

`cmd/ddev/cmd/start.go` → `pkg/ddevapp/ddevapp.Start()`

`Show me container lifecycle management`

`pkg/ddevapp/ddevapp.go` → Docker operations

--

#### Dependency Analysis

**System Relationships:**  

`Show me all packages that import dockerutil`

`Find functions that create Docker containers`

`Explain how configuration flows through the system`

`Map the relationship between DdevApp and container management`

--

#### Pattern Recognition

**DDEV Conventions:**  

`Show me DDEV's error handling patterns`

```go
// Standard DDEV error pattern:
if err := app.ValidateConfig(); err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("failed to validate config for %s: %w", app.Name, err)
}
```

`"How does DDEV handle logging?`

```go
// DDEV logging pattern:
util.Debug("Starting containers for %s", app.Name)
util.Success("Successfully started %s", app.Name)
util.Failed("Failed to start %s: %v", app.Name, err)
```

💡 **Navigation Strategy:** Start with "Explain the architecture" then drill down to specific components

--

### Go Development Patterns

#### DDEV-Specific Architecture Patterns

**1. Command Pattern Implementation:**  

`Show me how DDEV implements the command pattern`

Every DDEV command follows this structure:

```go
func NewCmdStart() *cobra.Command {
    cmd := &cobra.Command{
        Use:   "start [projectname ...]",
        Short: "Start a ddev project.",
        Long:  `Start initializes and configures the web server and database containers...`,
        RunE:  cmdStart,
    }
    return cmd
}

func cmdStart(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) error {
    // Command logic implementation
    // Always follows: validation → execution → error handling
}
```

--


🔧 **AI Development Tip:** Always ask Claude to "follow DDEV patterns" when generating new code

--

## Live Demonstrations

--

### Demo Overview

**Three real DDEV issues:**

1. **Issue #7424:** [FrankenPHP launch error](https://github.com/ddev/ddev/issues/7424)
2. **Issue #5337:** [Add-on dependency management](https://github.com/ddev/ddev/issues/5337)
3. **Issue #7537:** [Xdebug host resolution](https://github.com/ddev/ddev/issues/7537)

**Each demo shows:** Problem analysis → Solution design → Implementation → Testing

--

### Demo 1: FrankenPHP `ddev launch` problem, Issue #7424

#### Step 1: Prompt Claude to Explain the Issue

- Introduce Claude to [GitHub Issue #7424](https://github.com/ddev/ddev/issues/7424)

`Read https://github.com/ddev/ddev/issues/7424 and describe the problem with `ddev launch` and FrankenPHP.`

--

#### Step 2: Reproduce the Bug

`Build the HEAD code with make`

`Create a new trivial project in ~/tmp/launch-bug`

`Add the FrankenPHP add-on with ddev add-on get https://github.com/stasadev/ddev-frankenphp`

`ddev launch`


--

#### Step 3: Analyze and Identify the Root Cause

`Analyze the error message from the failed launch`

`Analyze the error output and the launch custom command. What is causing the failure with FrankenPHP?`

--

#### Step 4: Implement and Test the Fix

`fix the problem with the launch command`

--

### Demo 2: Allow add-ons to download other add-ons, Issue #5337

**Problem:** Allow add-ons to download other add-ons as dependencies

**AI-Assisted Approach:**

`Read https://github.com/ddev/ddev/issues/5337` and explain the goal and any involved complexities`

`What would the steps be to solve this problem?`

`What are the risks of implementing this feature?`

`Propose a solution`


--

### Demo 3: `host.docker.internal` handling for all containers, Issue #7537

**Problem:** Better `host.docker.internal` handling for all containers

- Explain to Claude what `host.docker.internal` is and how it's used in web container
- Explain why it might be useful in other containers (like a FrankenPHP container)
- Explain where it's currently defined in app_compose_template.yaml
- Get Claude to propose a solution

---

## Best Practices

Note: Section 5 of 6 - Guidelines for effective AI-assisted development

--

### Code Quality Principles

#### Core Guidelines for AI-Assisted Development

**🛡️ Respect Existing Test Coverage**
```go
// ❌ Don't do this: Modifying existing tests without clear justification
func TestExistingFunction(t *testing.T) {
    // Changed expected behavior without understanding impact
}

// ✅ Do this: Add new tests, preserve existing ones
func TestExistingFunction_NewScenario(t *testing.T) {
    // New test for additional functionality
}
```

--

**🔧 Leverage Static Analysis**
- **Use DDEV's existing tooling:** `make lint`, `make test`
- **Pre-commit hooks:** Let tools catch issues before review
- **Code formatting:** Run `gofmt` and follow Go conventions

--

**🏛️ Follow Project Conventions**
```go
// Ask Claude Code: "Make this function follow DDEV's conventions"
// Before: Inconsistent error handling
func badExample() error {
    return errors.New("something went wrong")
}

// After: DDEV-style error wrapping
func goodExample() error {
    return fmt.Errorf("failed to start app: %w", err)
}
```

--

### Testing Best Practices

#### AI-Powered Test Generation

**✨ AI Excels at Test Creation**
```go
// Prompt: "Generate comprehensive tests for this DDEV function"
func TestDdevApp_GetConfigPath(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name     string
        app      *DdevApp
        filename string
        want     string
    }{
        {
            name: "valid filename",
            app:  &DdevApp{AppConfDir: func() string { return "/app/.ddev" }},
            filename: "config.yaml",
            want: "/app/.ddev/config.yaml",
        },
        {
            name: "empty filename",
            app:  &DdevApp{AppConfDir: func() string { return "/app/.ddev" }},
            filename: "",
            want: "/app/.ddev",
        },
        // AI generates more edge cases...
    }
    // Test implementation...
}
```

--

**🔍 Review Generated Tests Carefully**
- **Verify assertions** make logical sense
- **Check edge cases** are actually edge cases  
- **Validate test data** represents real scenarios
- **Ensure tests fail** when they should
- **If you don't understand the test, it's not a great thing**

--

**🎯 Effective Test Generation Prompts**
- "Generate unit tests with edge cases for this function"
- "Create integration tests for DDEV container startup"
- "Add tests for error handling in this database function"

---

### Prompt Engineering

#### Crafting Effective Prompts for Development

**🎯 Be Specific About Requirements**
```
❌ Vague: "Fix this function"
✅ Specific: "Fix this function to handle MySQL 8.0 authentication, 
   following DDEV's error handling patterns and including unit tests"

❌ Unclear: "Make this better"  
✅ Clear: "Refactor this function to use DDEV's logging utilities 
   and improve error messages for users". Use the pattern found in ...
```

--

**📋 Provide Context About DDEV**
```
🏗️ Structure Context:
"This is part of DDEV's container management system. DDEV uses 
docker-compose to orchestrate containers. Follow existing patterns 
in pkg/ddevapp for container lifecycle management."

🧪 Testing Context:
"Generate tests following DDEV's testing patterns. Use testify/require, 
include both positive and negative test cases, and follow the existing 
test file structure in this directory."
```

--

**🔄 Iterate and Refine**
```
1️⃣ First attempt: "Add error handling to this function"
2️⃣ Refined: "Add DDEV-style error handling with proper error wrapping"
3️⃣ Specific: "Add error handling that wraps errors with context and 
    uses DDEV's util.Error() for user-facing messages"
```

--

**💡 Proven DDEV Prompts**
- "Explain how this DDEV component works and its dependencies"
- "Generate comprehensive tests for this function including edge cases"
- "Refactor this code to follow DDEV's Go conventions and patterns"
- "Add proper documentation following DDEV's documentation style"
